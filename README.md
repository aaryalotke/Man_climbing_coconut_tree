# Man_climbing_coconut_tree
A simple animation created using graphics.h library in C++. The animation depicts a man climbing a coconut tree to pluck some coconuts. A coconut falls from the tree and the man climbs down with the coconuts.

Here is a brief explanation of the code:

The code starts by including the necessary header files for graphics.h, conio.h, and dos.h. The code then declares several integer variables. The background() and background2() functions are defined to display the background screen of the animation.

The main() function initializes the graphics mode and displays the first background screen using the background() function. The animation starts with the man climbing up the coconut tree. This is done by drawing the man using several geometric shapes and lines. The animation is created by erasing the previous frame and drawing the next frame repeatedly.

After the man reaches the top of the tree, a coconut falls down, which is shown using a green circle and brown lines. The man then climbs down the tree with the coconuts. Finally, the man reaches the ground with the coconuts and the animation stops.
